Project name : Triends

Project Description 

Triends is a travel web application for users who travel on their own or want to meet new people and make new friends on their journey.   
New people will be found by usersâ€™ preference setting and their profile which is their own setting for other users.
Not only you find the people but also the app has a functionality to send a message to friends whom you would like to spend time with for a specific event. 
One of the functions that the app has is displaying local events around the users in 5 km that users can enjoy in wherever they are.
